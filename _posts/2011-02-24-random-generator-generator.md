After seeing the [random startup generator](http://www.ykombinator.com/) and the [Malcolm Gladwell book generator](http://www.malcolmgladwellbookgenerator.com/), I decided to save everyone a lot of time by making the [Random Generator Generator](http://thjnk.com/random/).

The script chooses an array of subjects and an array of contexts, and then combines them for your enjoyment. As a bonus, it gives you the code for the random generator you generated. 

I defined some of the subjects myself, but sometimes the Random Generator Generator will get a subject via [Wikipedia's Special:Random](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Random). The results from Wikipedia are sometimes difficult to understand, but occasionally I have been entertained or offended.
